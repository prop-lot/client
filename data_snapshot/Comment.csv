730,"appreciate the feedback, I think the take on starting with smaller niche newsletters is an interesting take. I can see larger marketing initiative where we spread the message of Lil Nouns by sponsoring multiple smaller audience newsletters and podcasts. It's a great way to create some organic growth for the dao. With that said, numbers don't lie, we could exclude bankless with this proposal, still have the editorial interview where we are interviewed on the Green pill and drastically decrease overall costs. But 1.8 million DLs per month has a ton of potential value   The thing that's nice about this is it is a combined marketing outreach. We're getting the editorial interview which provides a deep dive into lil nouns dao while also shining a spotlight on the engaged community members. It gives dedicated members who are participating a platform to improve their social capital at the same time that we are promoting the community and pipeline of lilnounsdao.   The goal is to onboard new members into the community. Bankless is a trusted source of information in the the web3 world. New users often have a difficult time understanding which contracts or nft communities are legit and which are malicious. This marketing outreach effort helps to solidify our reputation by entering into the conversation with the bankless community as well as the gitcoin community which focuses on public goods and has a very large community of builders/devs. It will aso serve to open the door for dao-dao community relations.   My goal with the advertisement is to open with the activation of ""robonoun"" and then transition to shots where robonoun begins assembling the lil nouns logo with the help of other lil nouns then they present it to Nouns. The aim is to create excitement, drive interest in lilnounsdao as a quality content hub and promote interest in building while also promoting our pipeline to the world outside our direct community.  The verbal advertisement is created after we complete a sponsor onboarding form. Bankless has a sponsor onboarding Q/A which they then use to form the call to action and direct users toward our platform. I would keep the community engaged by being transparent when constructing these responses to their onboarding Q/A and together we can make sure that we maximize our potential for yielding a good result.

951,"sqx10.eth and mikegood.eth - Thanks so much for taking the time to provide feedback and for your overall enthusiasm for our prop! I've looked at your comments and have some responses below:

(sqx10.eth) I think something lacking in the ecosystem is the ""give back"" this is a give back prop. all nounders receive an item . gives 16 to utilize in Lils. Nounders get some for teh DAO to use as giveaways / prizes , etc... this is teh crypto flywheel IMO . Nounish . Life Gains.

A: I‚Äôll elaborate on this in mikegood.eth‚Äôs questions, but we totally agree and tried to structure as much ‚Äúgive backs‚Äù as we could in return for the Nouns support in the development of the project. These come as both tangibles (1,001 physicals) and the intangibles of marketing, content, sponsorship etc. We spent a lot of time thinking critically about our last proposal and how it could be drastically improved. We believe this project will give significant value to the Nouns community now and in the future, as well as sub-groups in the ecosystem like the Lil Nouns.

Suggestion: Some type of easy QR code to help bridge the normie gap. possibly to nouns museum and gallery? just spit-balling. 

We‚Äôve gotten a lot of positive feedback that this project will help bridge the gap to people outside the Nouns community who may not understand the project as art, or in general! Per the QR suggestion, we plan on making as much creation content available online as we can. That includes hi-res images of finished pieces, timelapses of their creation, and other information that can help showcase the artistic process. Suggestions like this are great and exactly why we want to keep the community informed during the entire development process, so we can find ways to make the project more useful to the goals of Nouns DAO (e.g. better rationalizing Nouns DAO to people outside the community). If this does not fully answer your question, please feel free to follow up or reach out here or in the Lil Nouns Discord.


(mikegood.eth) Ok, so.... a few issues I see here:

This assumes nouns 1-1000 are willing to dox their addresses to get these printed, right? So essentially, you'll have the addresses of all Nouners at the end of this, lol... just sayin'

A: We commit to doing everything we can to ensure the anonymity of the Nouns DAO community. We are closely aligned with a number of other cryptoart companies who have been working to address this issue (Artfora, for example) and we are working with them on solutions. It is something that we need to consider for any future project, particularly at high volume. We are exploring address escrow services, secure databases that automatically delete information after use, and other methods. We want to work with the community in a variety of ways to ensure as many people have access to physical prints as possible and would post instructions on how to address a package to a UPS store, for instance.

B. Personally think half a million dollars is too much based on the success of the original prop ... I wonder how this is going to proliferate outward, beyond Nouners and help onboard new folk? Each drawing will cost about $400~ to produce? 

A: We are eager to develop and employ our new tech at the epic scale that it was built for. We went big with this project, and want the community to feel that their money is well spent. It is easy to quantify the project on a per-print cost basis, but do keep in mind that we are also committing to a constant stream of content, marketing, and PR on behalf of the Nouns DAO, an epic NYC event as part of the Nouniversary celebrations, and development of a new Matr Labs robot that will be Nouns sponsored and branded. We feel that these intangibles will bring a lot of value and visibility to the community, while allowing us the opportunity to build the tech to its full potential in a shortened period of  time. 

C. Is there a plan to make this self sustainable? <-- this has been a big question from Nouner's recently on like every prop. Wondering if you've been asked this?

A: This tech platform is a significant part of our future development pipeline with the artists, platforms and galleries that we are working with. We also are developing ways for the public to access this tech and ‚ÄúMatr‚Äù their own custom creations. We have plans to scale this product to democratize the creation of physical artwork. In the medium term, it will allow us to have a sustainable solution for artists to work on ideas that may be higher volume and more accessible to a larger collector base. Having Nouns DAO as our development sponsor will accelerate our timeline and product viability for artists to start using it. We think this will be one of our marquee tools, and Nouns will cement themselves in the art community with the legacy and visibility of being the first to use it.

Im surprised some of the more fiscally conservative folks here in Lil's are supporting this without more questions.

A: We have been reaching out to the members of the Lils and Nouns over the past two weeks as we have developed this idea, so many community suggestions have already been included in this iteration of the proposal. We are happy to have a conversation with anyone in the community who may have additional questions.

End of day i love what you guys are doing, seems very cool and I hear the studio was fun to see in person.

A: Thank you very much, we‚Äôve had a great experience with the Nouns and Lil Nouns communities and are excited to work together again. We are building a collaborative ecosystem of some of the most forward-thinking creatives in the space and we are proud to count Nouns as a partner and early adopter. As for the studio, we have an open door policy! If you are in New York please do not hesitate to reach out to us to schedule a tour.

959,"ADDED INFO 

NFTR can assign 10 naming credits per address at a time. So it would just be two naming transactions. One with 10 namings and another with 6 namings.
Naming fee is being waved as we're giving lil nouns 16 naming credits so that part is also free.
btw, how do i upvote on prop lot? i've got lils in that wallet but can't press the up arrow after connecting.

the general idea i have is:
run the naming (possibly in tandem... ) through calabara -> this will provide a lot of social interaction. allow others to offer up suggestions as well... and splash timelines with pics of Lil's Nouns ... It will also be some good advertising for NFTR hopefullly...
take those names and then set up Prop House to select the Winners. possibly even lower it to 1 vote per wallet? üå∂Ô∏è
take selected winning names and create 1 Prop to push on chain by Lil Nounders and @lil al409

a fun aside with the naming could be providing ""pics"" of the Noun in the Name... to create more imagery. in the social space. either by the name submitter or we run with in house artists to push pics of the names onto the noun.... or we just ""AI"" it",543,"0x2eE0485f71764bcD2062A84d9455688c581B90f8",,"2023-06-01 12:26:30.411","2023-06-01 12:26:30.411",FALSE

972,"Hi there, Chris aka chrismeetworld here üôÇ For the what happens after the 5 shots question: I think part of the fun of this is taking it into the real world. I love seeing physical posters pasted up all around the city. I love catching fun billboards that make me curious. And as much as it's great to continue connecting with people who are already in the crypto space, I think what this prop does is hopefully create something that can spark curiosity for a whole new group of people who don't know about Nouns yet. 

And I want to do this IRL part through a fun droposal where NFTs of the scenes are minted and those funds are fully used to take this thing out into into physical spaces. Each of the finished one-shots will have the noggles and nouns.wtf in the bottom corner (which on a billboard will be huge!) as a sort of CTA.

I see this as doing character development in a way that only Nouns can. And as far as future funding goes, if it's good, effective and fun (this one being the most important!), I believe there will be a number of ways to continue having the budget to create including - but not limited to - future props, advertiser involvement and even bringing on a trad media partner to continue the development of the project into a full on series, which would be such a cool story. Prop -> NFTs -> Billboards -> Series -> NFTs -> More billboards... onboarding people to Nouns and the idea of onchain the whole time https://twitter.com/chrismeetworld/status/1692119669690237205

Obviously lots of thinking out loud (my keyboard is noisy), and with anything 'building in public', new good and better ideas will come in throughout the process to help refine all of this and make it all even better, but wanted to just drop some initial thoughts here for transparency and clarity.
