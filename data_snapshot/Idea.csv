There are currently 7 addresses on the MS but only 2 are currently active. Myself and Lil Dot.

In recent weeks it has become apparent that this is unsustainable due to work, travel and the like and as such, I propose that our sole Noun is delegated on a monthly basis to a Lil Nouns holder.

The vote to delegate could take place using snapshot or equivalent, as to not incur gas fees.

- Reward Lil Nouns with Nouns governance for a month 
- Potentially attract new builders who like the idea of being able to govern with a Noun for a period of time

The main objective of this proposal is to assess the extent of worries and address potential remedies for Lil Nouners to enable their participation in Nouns governance through Nouns VWR. 

The proposal aims to delve deeper into their challenges and concerns and develop viable independent solutions to ensure active involvement through the Nouns VWR. 

## Rationale
It can be frustrating for subDAO token holders not to receive gas refunds for zero votes, especially after investing hard-earned money.

It is perplexing that while Nouns are willing to spend significant amounts on memes, subDAOs are not part of that trend. 

However, it is worth considering introducing a system where Lil Nouns holders receive refunds for the gas they spent on zero votes if we believe zero votes are valuable contributions to the ecosystem.

By doing so, we can incentivize more people to join Lil Nouns and participate without worrying about the cost of gas, ultimately leading to a more vibrant and diverse community.","0x9e0e9D25a5ED9bc773f91691f0b45599255257B1",3,7176,FALSE,18647209,0

Still, again, it's due to the lack of enough public and accessible information about contribution status.

Others may disagree, but I want to see Lil Nounders act individually here if they want to vote or not vote on the proposal. 

Also, I don't see any reason we need Lil Nounder's votes on any proposal to be passed if we implement DQ. Even though I've tried multiple times, I have yet to get a clear answer on-chain.

If they chose to vote on some proposals rather than others due to the lack of enough votes to pass because they don't do that based on overall votes, they better implement DQ, which is a better option.

If it does, the function uses the first available `Noun` token for the new auction. If no tokens are available within the contract, it returns to minting a new `Noun` token. Once the `Noun` token is selected or minted, the function creates a new auction with that token, setting the start and end times based on the current block timestamp and the auction's duration. This approach allows the contract to utilize existing tokens before generating new ones, optimizing the use of resources.

In the modified setup, `Noun` tokens are sent to the `NounsAuctionHouse` contract through a governance proposal. Once the tokens are in the contract, the `_createAuction` function checks for their presence. If an existing token is found, it is used for the new auction, thereby optimizing resource utilization by avoiding unnecessary minting.

Once a consensus is reached, the finalized proposal will be added to the Lil Nouns DAO as a new experiment on-chain. Afterward, it will be submitted to the Nouns DAO for consideration.

## Rationale

Lil Dot has been an instrumental figure in the development and growth of Lil Nouns DAO. As the most active founder, Lil Dot has consistently attended meetings, participated in discussions, and contributed to technical aspects of the DAO. The allocation of a Noun to Lil Dot would serve as a fitting acknowledgment of these efforts and further align incentives for ongoing contributions to the ecosystem.","0x9e0e9D25a5ED9bc773f91691f0b45599255257B1",3,7165,FALSE,18448117,0

With the $38,000 proposal funding, MakeWater is set to ignite a bathroom culture revolution in the U.S. Our pilot project will distribute free Nouns-branded bidets to low-to-middle-income households. The budget covers bidet purchase, installation, and an educational campaign that empowers students to become citizen scientists. They will gather and share data on bidet usage, cost savings, and environmental impact. Installation guides, student water facility field trips,  and video diaries of our journey will further enrich public understanding of this sustainable practice. Our model is designed for scalability, ensuring continual bidet distribution in the long term.

**Creating For Nouns**

I have been creating content for Nouns and Lils for a while. I've made animations for Nouns Amigos and for Lils (I'm still creating more), as well as for Nouns (You can see all that content in the Candidate prop). After all this work, I would love to finally see one of my ideas on-chain, and I would love it even more with the support of Lil Nouns!

Dynamic Quorum Parameter
As articulated in this [detailed post](https://mirror.xyz/0x10072dfc23771101dC042fD0014f263316a6E400/96zSoFfiT_RM2o2P9UbVKxPzVpB_trZqUjzllBE00BE), three parameters need to be set for a dynamic quorum.

Current Settings
Currently, all parameters match the previous 10% base quorum and do not activate dynamic quorum.

Minimum quorum %: 10%
Maximum quorum %: 10%
Coefficient: 0

Proposed Settings
Reducing the minimum quorum should increase the percentage of successful “hell yes” proposals.

Set the coefficient to 1, such that each against vote raises the quorum requirement by one vote until the maximum quorum is reached

","Origin has recently launched Origin ETH (OETH), a yield aggregator for ETH that generates superior returns for ETH holders. Origin has been around since 2017 and raised $38M from top investors including Pantera and Spartan Group. OETH is an additive solution to Lido and allows holders of ETH and stETH to earn additional yield. Launched three months ago, OETH already has $73M in TVL from a combination of DAOs and institutions and is the second biggest yield aggregator on Ethereum for ETH (https://defillama.com/yields?token=ETH&chain=Ethereum&category=Yield+Aggregator)

We want to stand by Nouns and not fork our Nouns due to obvious reasons but there is an arbitrage play whereby it could be possible for us to exit and rejoin the DAO amassing more than our original number Nouns without spending addition ETH. We are extremely keen to own more Nouns so this has to be considered. There is big debate whether buying new Nouns right now is the best spend of our increasingly-limited treasury.

Receiving these locked Nouns would increase theoretical future BV of LIL and could drive more interest to LIL auctions which currently aren't seeing a huge amount of love. This is arguably the best entry point for Nounish collectors/those interested in governance of Nouns.

LIL should be seen as the lifeblood of Nouns and I personally believe it is in a (true) Nouner's interest to drive as much value to Lil Nouns DAO as possible. We aren't taking anything away from Nouns DAO here, just attempting to decentralise and expand the DAO to the right people.

However, there are multiple challenges when it comes to engaging voters.  1) There is no reliable notification mechanism to let DAO members know voting has started, or that proposals have been submitted 2) The only notification is through discord, which is noisy with competing channels, notifications for meetings, town halls etc.   So, with our current set-up, there is no predictability on when people are required to vote.  Solution: So i'm proposing that we experiment with ritualized voting (i.e. voting on the same day each week). Here's how it would work: all proposals submitted on chain and held in queue until a specific date/time (i.e. 12pm et every Monday). All proposals then go live, and DAO members can read and vote accordingly.  Having this predictability will improve voter engagement, because there is now a reliable time they can block off in their calendar to read + vote. Can also create twitter spaces each week to discuss.","0x56383A5Dd01d413fb8B38F2D0FceF5F511F1Dbb9",3,7000,FALSE,16683000,0
